    "### Types of Services\n",
    "1. ClusterIP\n",
    "    - If the Service type is not defined at the time of Service creation, a ClusterIP is the the default service type\n",
    "    - allows communiocation within the cluster (e.g. comminication between an apps frontend and backend).\n",
    "    - The range of IPs available are specified at the time of cluster ceratrtion using the option $\\texttt{service-cluster-ip-range}$\n",
    "    - To find the cluster IP a cluster run the command $\\texttt{kuberctl get svc <service\\_name>}$\n",
    "2. NodePort\n",
    "    - created if a app needs to be acceessed outside the cluster, by endpoints on the same netwok.\n",
    "    - Kubernete's control plane allocates a port from a range specified by the option $\\texttt{--service-node-port-range}$\n",
    "        - default range: $\\texttt{30000-32767}$\n",
    "    - $\\emph{Headless Service}$ - If load balancing is not required  you can set $\\texttt{.spec.clusterIP}$ to false. The app will not recieve a cluster IP.\n",
    "    - To create a NodePort Service run:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        kubectl create svc nodeport hello --tcp=80:8080\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "3. LoadBalancer\n",
    "    - Created if an application needs to be exposed to The Internet or WAN.\n",
    "    - Kubernetes creates a service similar to NodePort Service, and the $\\texttt{cloud-control-manager}$ at the same time creates a cloiud provider-specific load balancer.\n",
